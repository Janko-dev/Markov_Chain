# Markov Chain
This repository contains examples of Markov chain state machines and their applications written in C. The contents of the folder `Word_generation` provide a way to generate random words by analyzing a list of existing words. Through analysis of the provided dataset, probability weights are calculated for the states of every alphabetic letter and their transitions to other letters. These are then used to generate words. 

## Quick start
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Janko-dev/Markov_Chain.git
$ cd Markov_Chain/Word_generation
$ make
$ ./wgen -d <filepath> <num_generated_words>
```
- `-d` flag is an optional flag that enables debug output (like printing the calculated transition matrix)
- `<filepath>` is the file path parameter that is used to read the training data for the model. Provide a correct filepath that contains a list of words seperated by **line breaks**.
- `<num_generated_words>` is the number of words that will be generated by the model.
